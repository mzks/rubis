You are free to contribute to this repository with issues and pull requests.
Pull requests are preferable, but it is also good to simply let authors know what features you want in an Issue. 
It is also useful to report bugs and unintended specifications instead of fixing them.
Issues and pull requests may be submitted in **any language**, not just English. 
When submitting a pull request, please pay attention to the results of the GitHub Action test. 
We do not necessarily require all changes to pass the tests, but we do want to **maintain backward compatibility** of the software as much as possible. 
If you think there is a problem with the tests, you are encouraged to discuss it in the Conversation.
Docstrings and type hints are not necessarily required, but they are nice to have.
